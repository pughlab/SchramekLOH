# SchramekLOH
Analysis for the ADAM10 and AJUBA LOH in HNSC

 * Contains the TCGA-Schramek_LOH-calling.R script.  Currently, this is a locally working version of the LOH + CN + Expr calling pipeline.  It's a bit messy but was used to generate some basic contigency  + chisquare tests, as well as output the visualization of LOH + CN + Expr values.
